/**
 * This abstract class contains the functionality for pausing, resetting and stopping
 * a thread. Instead of implementing {@link Runnable}, extending with
 * {@link ControlledRunnable} gives access to {@link #pause(boolean)}/{@link #pause(boolean, boolean)},
 * {@link #reset()} and {@link #stop()}/{@link #stop(boolean)}. {@link ControlledRunnable}
 * then offers several methods which can be used in the program flow to act on the different
 * states. This class also provides the possibility to register {@link ControlledRunnableListener}s
 * which are notified of state changes. The listeners are notified when a state change has been requested 
 * and once the state has been reached.<br />
 * <br />
 * Is not possible for {@link ControlledRunnable} to know during your
 * own program flow implementation when it is a good time to stop, reset or pause
 * the execution. Therefore, the pause/reset/stop methods only set an internal state which
 * needs to be checked in your runnable class in order to get the desired behavior.
 * This means that methods like {@link #runStart()}, {@link #runEnd()},
 * {@link #runPause(boolean, boolean)}, {@link #isResetRequested()}, {@link #isPauseRequested()}
 * or {@link #isStopRequested()} have to be used in your runnable to control the
 * behavior.<br>
 * <br>
 * A run method in your runnable could look like this:<br>
 * <pre>
 * public void run() {
 *	{@link #runStart()};
 *	
 *	//Main loop. Keeping the thread running
 *	while (!{@link #isStopRequested()}) {
 *		//The reset point of the program could be here
 *		{@link #runReset()}
 *		//Pause (if requested). Do not exit when reset is called.
 *		//This method implements the pausing and blocks as long as the pause state is set.
 *		{@link #runPause(boolean)}
 *
 *		if ({@link #isStopRequested()}) {
 *			//Exit the while-loop to end the thread
 *			break;
 *		}
 *
 *		if ({@link #isResetRequested()}) {
 *			//Reset could just mean "start again at the beginning". It is up to the
 *			//implementation on how to use it.
 *			continue;
 *		}
 *
 *		//Do your stuff...
 *		//Use any of the offered methods to control the program flow
 *		//depending on the controlled runnable state.
 *		//Methods to use in addition to the ones mentioned already in this example:
 *		//{@link #controlledWait()}
 *		//{@link #controlledWait(long)}
 *		//{@link #isPauseRequested()}
 *		//Any of the {@link #pause()} methods to request a pause
 *		//
 *		//Hint: Instead of using wait() on a object directly, use one of the controlledWait
 *		//methods if you want the implementation to react to any pause/reset/stop etc. calls. The
 *		//controlledWait methods use the wait() internally but exit the wait if
 *		//reset() or stop() is called.
 *
 *	}
 *
 *	{@link #runEnd()}
 * }
 * 
 * </pre>
 * <br />
 * The idea is that any object that wants to interact with the {@link ControlledRunnable}
 * can request it to stop, pause or reset. The runnable implementation then defines
 * how those states are reached. The implementation might first have to finish a certain task
 * before it can reach the requested state, or it might or might not wake up from a
 * waiting state to reach the requested state. It is completely up to the implementation.
 * <br />
